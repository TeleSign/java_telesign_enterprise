# Telesign Full-service Java SDK

[Telesign](https://telesign.com) connects, protects, and defends the customer experience with intelligence from billions of digital interactions and mobile signals. Through developer-friendly APIs that deliver user verification, digital identity, and omnichannel communications, we help the world's largest brands secure onboarding, maintain account integrity, prevent fraud, and streamline omnichannel engagement.

## Requirements

* **JDK 7+**
* ***_(Optional)_*** **Gradle** This package manager isn't required to use this SDK, but it is required to use the installation instructions below.
* ***_(Optional)_*** **Kotlin** This domain-specific langage (DSL) isn't required to use this SDK, but it is required to use the installation instructions below. These installation steps rely on using Kotlin as your DSL for the build script in the Gradle project. Some steps need to be adapted if you are using Groovy as your DSL.

> NOTE:
>
> These instructions are for MacOS. They will need to be adapted if you are installing on Windows.

## Installation

Follow these steps to add this SDK as a dependency to your project.

1. Create a new directory to download the Telesign SDK. This should not be in the same directory as where you build your integration.

```
    cd ~/code/local
    mkdir telesign_sdks
    cd telesign_sdks
```

2. Clone this repo. A new directory should appear called `java_telesign_enterprise`:

   `git clone https://github.com/TeleSign/java_telesign_enterprise.git`

3. Create another directory (this must be outside of the SDK directory you just created) where you want to create your Telesign integration. Skip this step if you already have created a project. If you plan to create multiple Java projects that use Telesign, we recommend that you group them within a `telesign_integrations` directory.

```
    cd ~/code/local
    mkdir telesign_integrations
    cd telesign_integrations
    mkdir {your project name}
    cd {your project name}
```

4. Create a new Gradle project.

   `gradle init`

5. Select the following options at each of the prompts that appear at the command line.

* *Select type of project to generate:* `2: application`
* *Select implementation language:* `3: Java`
* *Select build script DSL:* `2: Kotlin`
* *Select test framework:* `1: JUnit 4`
* *Project name (default: sms):* `sendSMS`
* *Source package (default: sendSMS):* Hit Enter to use the default.

You should then see a message that indicates the build was successful.

6. Copy all the .java source files from the Telesign Full-service Java SDK into your project:

   `cp -r ~/code/local/telesign_sdks/java_telesign_enterprise/src/main/java/com ./src/main/java/`

7. Open the build.gradle.kts file in your project and add `mavenCentral()` to the `repositories` block right below `jcenter()`.

8. Add the following dependencies to the `dependencies` block:

   ```
   implementation("com.google.guava:guava:29.0-jre")
   implementation("com.google.code.gson:gson:2.2.+")
   implementation ("com.squareup.okio:okio:2.9.0")
   implementation("com.telesign:telesign:2.3.0")
   ```

The last of these statements imports the Telesign Self-service SDK. This is needed because the Telesign Full-service SDK also uses some functionality in the Self-service SDK.

## Authentication

If you use a Telesign SDK to make your request, authentication is handled behind-the-scenes for you. All you need to provide is your Customer ID and API Key. The SDKs apply Digest authentication whenever they make a request to a Telesign service where it is supported. When Digest authentication is not supported, the SDKs apply Basic authentication.
